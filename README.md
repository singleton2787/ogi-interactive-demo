# OGI Framework Validation Suite

Mathematical validation and empirical experiments for "Addressing Mathematical Rigor in the Open General Intelligence Framework: A Critical Analysis and Formal Implementation"

## Overview

This repository contains implementation code and validation experiments for the theoretical claims made in the OGI framework follow-up paper. The code provides empirical verification of mathematical theorems related to communication complexity reduction in modular cognitive architectures.

## Core Experiments

### 1. Lipschitz Stability Validation (Theorem 1)
Empirically verifies that the dynamic weighting function Φ(c, et) maintains L2-norm stability against bounded perturbations.
```python
python experiments/stability_test.py 
Expected Output:

Theoretical Lipschitz constant L
Empirical output differences for various perturbation magnitudes
Verification that ||Φ(c₁,et) - Φ(c₂,et)||₂ ≤ L||c₁-c₂||₂

2. Complexity Analysis (Theorems 2 & 3)
Demonstrates the O(n²) communication bottleneck and validates the O(k²+n) reduction via Top-K gating.
pythonpython experiments/complexity_test.py
Metrics:

Full mesh complexity: O(n²dm)
Top-K gating complexity: O(k²dm + n·dcda)
Measured reduction: 70-90%

3. Executive Control Validation
Tests task switching costs and distractor robustness of the k-active gating mechanism.
pythonpython experiments/executive_control_test.py

Paper
Preprint: [arXiv link when published]
Abstract: The Open General Intelligence (OGI) framework proposes a modular cognitive architecture for artificial general intelligence but lacks mathematical rigor in its core formulations. This paper provides formal mathematical foundations, stability theorems, and complexity analysis with empirical validation.
